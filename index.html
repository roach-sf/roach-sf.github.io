    <h1>Roach</h1>

    <p>
      Roach is a writer working in literary nonfiction. His work is built from direct experience and sustained observation, with an emphasis on honesty, restraint, and long-form attention. He is interested in what remains after survival—how meaning is formed, how memory settles, and how truth stands when it is no longer defended. His current manuscript, STRONG AND FREE, is a completed work that resists explanation and asks to be read on its own terms.
